# Decides if a graph is Eulerian.
#
# Argument n specifies that the graph has n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1. Argument edges is a list of pairs of vertices denoting undirected edges. If vertex i is connected to vertex j, then edge contains either the pair (i,j) or the pair (j,i). If a pair appears multiple time in edge (in any order), it means the corresponding vertices are linked multiple times.
#
# A graph is simple if any two vertices are connected at most once, and the graph has no loop of the form (i,i).
#
# The function should return True if the graph contains a Eulerian cycle (i.e., a cycle that visit each edge exactly once), and False otherwise. Note that a graph with no edge is Eulerian (an empty cycle will visit all edges).


# Examples :
# print(is_eulerian(5, [(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,2),(3,1),(4,1),(3,2),(2,4),(4,3)])) -> True
#  KÃ¶nigsberg 7 bridges
# print(is_eulerian(4, [(0,2),(2,3),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1),(3,1),(1,2)])) -> False
# print(is_eulerian(4, [])) -> True
